# Brackets Link File

Easily link your files (PHP, JavaScript, CSS, images, audio, video, fonts) into the focused document (HTML, PHP, CSS). You can copy several files in one time to your project folders and get them tagged automatically in the current document. 

Supports linking of existing files in the project tree. Also, with a file selection dialog (with image previews) or directly with drag and drop from OS file browser, allows copying files to project which will be tagged automatically.

It also supports bi-directionality: if you delete or rename a project file, the tag or tags are automatically deleted or updated in the document.

Supports direct download of libraries from CDN. You can download and link the library automatically in the document. Or just get a tag with the URL of the library for remote usage.

#### Important!

GNU/Linux users can't drag & drop files from OS file browser since Brackets 1.11, because It has completely lost this functionality on this operating system. 

## Install from Brackets

1. Open the Extension Manager from the File menu
2. Search Brackets Link File and install


## Install from file system

1. Download this extension using the ZIP button above and unzip it.
2. Copy it in Brackets' `/extensions/user` folder by selecting `Help > Show Extension Folder` in the menu. 
3. Reload Brackets.

## Usage

(Note that the extension only works if the focused document was saved previously).
#### Files already in the project tree

Just drag the file from the project tree and drop it on the editor. The link with the correct relative path will be inserted into the document on cursor postion.

Or right click on a file in the Project tree -> Link File (Insert Tags) for the same result.

#### Selecting several files anywhere

Right click on the destination directory in the Project tree -> Link File (Insert Tags). You will be prompted with a dialog where you can select one or more files anywhere on your hard disk or any other volume. These files will be automatically copied to this directory and the correct tags will be added in the focused document. 

The custom file selection dialog is capable of displaying preview thumbnails of image files, filter the file list via filter input box (rigth click it to get a dropdown menu with pre-defined filter sets) and toggle showing hidden files.

#### Dragging and dropping from OS file browser

At the bottom of the sidebar you can see the drop area (resizable). And in it, in the bottom, the current directory where the files that you drop into will be copied. Hover over this to see the full path.

To change the destination directory, right click on the desired in the project tree -> Link File (Set As Drop Area Destination).

Open a file browser on your operating system and drop files into the drop area.

You can toggle show/hide the drop area in the Preferences dialog (View -> Link File Settings).

#### Using bi-directional linking

This is a feature disabled by default. Because in projects with an extensive number of directories and files, it can slow down Brackets a bit.

To enable/disable it, go to the Preferences dialog (View -> Link File Settings).

Once enabled, the extension will recognize when a project file is deleted or renamed. If deleted, It will automatically delete the corresponding tags in the current document. If renamed, It will automatically update tags according the new name.

#### Downloading libraries or getting tags from JSDelivr CDN.

Right click on the destination directory in the Project tree -> Link File (Download Library). You will be prompted with a dialog where you can see the library list first page (500 items).

In the dialog header, there is a filter box to search on the currently viewed libraries. And in the dialog footer, there is a navigation bar where you can go page up and down or write page number directly.

You can click on library name to get description, author, homepage and Github page*. 

Every library item has four buttons on right side. The one starting from right, lets you choose the library version to use.

Second one let you choose the target file to download or get tagged.

Third one inserts a tag with the library file URL for remore usage. 

And the fourth button downloads the library file to the selected folder and insert the corresponding tag in the active document with the correct relative path.

\* *New jsDelivr API don't provide this kind of information. We are using the old API for that. For this reason, many libraries that were not found in the old API will not have a description. In this case, you will see a Google search link.*
